# Versioning

A quick and dirty solution to handling update checking.

## What's going on here?

Basically, this is a quick and dirty hack that allows anybody on the team to update the latest version without having to commit to the backend.

Please **do not** update this unless you are the one releasing a new versions.
This versioning mechanism affects users across all versions of Peacock, and we don't want to accidentally give users the wrong version.

## Release channels

- Stable: the current stable build.
- Nightly: the current alpha or beta build.
- Bleeding: the current bleeding edge build.
